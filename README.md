### Mission Context

The client, The Gaming Room, required a strategic plan to expand their existing Android game, "Draw It or Lose It," into a web-based, multi-platform application. The primary objective was to maximize market reach and user engagement by making the game accessible across various devices and operating systems without compromising performance or security.
